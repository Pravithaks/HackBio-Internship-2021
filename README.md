# HackBio-Internship-2021
**HackBio Internship 2021**

HackBio is a practice-oriented, virtually structured research internship aimed at providing advanced bioinformatics and computational biology skills to African scientists. The ultimate goal of the internship are :-

- African scientists' bioinformatics capabilities should be expanded.
- Increase the number of young African scientists who are connected.
- Boost bioinformatics research in Africa.
- Increase public awareness of biological science and its global ramifications.

**#BENEFITS**
- They improved their knowledge of a specific bioinformatics method.
- At the very least, have a peer-reviewed publication to show for your internship.
 
 **#STAGES**
 
 Stages 0-4 are the most difficult and research-intensive stages of the internship.
 **STAGE 0**: Eliminating individuals who are brand new to the game and aren't ready to learn on the fly. 3 days of simple activities
 **STAGE 1**: Achieve digital collaboration among participants using common technologies; those who are unable to collaborate will be eliminated (4 days).
 **STAGE 2**: Individuals are divided into different biostacks according to the subject. Preliminary exercises on programme usage, the Linux environment, and basic language debugging. (1 week; 60 people progress to the next stage)
 **STAGE 3**: Reshuffling of individuals into 5 teams and assignment of the 5 projects. All participants who get to this stage will receive a badge of honor. (1 week; 40 persons scale through and enter stage 4)
**STAGE 4**: Submit all results in their raw form, as well as all codes, designs, and the final manuscript draught.

**BIOSTACKS**
While registering for the internship, each intern is expected to select one BIOSTACK. It can be adjusted till the first stage is finished.
They include:
● genomics
● drug development
● vaccine informatics
● medicinal chemistry
● cheminformatics
● data analytics
● software development
● science communication
● publication image design
● bioinformatics frontend/UI/UX

**TOOLS NEED TO INSTALLED ON PC**
- Slack
- R Cloud 
- Unix Environment (Putty for Windows)
